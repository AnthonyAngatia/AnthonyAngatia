    <p>Anthony Angatia is a passionate developer. Currently he is completing his Computer Science Degree at Strathmore University in Kenya.</p>
    <p>
       He is very thoughtful in his works and very practical.
        He always seeks the right way of doing things, basically, he likes clean code even though sometimes he breaks this rule when he run out of time.
         He prefers writing code rather than long stories.</p>
         <p>He is dedicated to his work and tries to get the job done.
            He aims to acquire and share vast knowledge in various technologies in the near future while putting his core focus on backend technologies.</p>
            <p>At times I make people laugh. I prefer a 'not dull' environment.</p>
            <p>Parting Shot: Never stop trying as long as you are convinced it is the right thing to do.
               However, `Nemo judex in causa sua` no-one is judge in his own cause. Get some good people to oversee 'it/you'.</p>
